a. The program will show an error saying that test-a.txt doesn't exist.
b. 7 & 13 - the program creates the file with that text and returns the number of characters. Each time the file is written to in this state, all the data is overwritten.
c. The last thing that was written will be in the file, with all previous content having been overwritten. So in this case it's "another line \n"
d. The contents for this file will be "test d \n another line \n". This is because the second part of the program is appending the "another line" onto the first line, and so nothing is overwritten.
