Look at the program above:
a. What will be printed out when this program is run?
    Nothing will be printed out. It returns a * 2, but then nothing is done with it.

b. What would you add to the program to get it to print out what the calling the function yo(3) returns?
    Add another line to print the result e.g.
        print(yo(3))
