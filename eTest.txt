This is just a test to see how many e's will feature in this file. I could write anything really just as long as it contains real worlds with real meaning.

I realize as I write this though, that I am probably entering a few more e's than I normally would. Perhaps that is bias, or maybe, just maybe, I like the letter e.

Everything I type here should be counted. Even the capitalized e's!
